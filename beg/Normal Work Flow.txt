Normal Work Flow
-----------------
1.register (tkinter) stores in user table
2.username n password input
3.login (tkinter) checks with user table
4.system start to listen
5.passive listener listen in backgroud
6.checking for hotword 'jarvis'
7.once accept change mode to active else stay in passive checks for hot word 
8.once change to active mode modules for particular text is finded
10.do the operations/ update db if any
11.produce sound output

Speech
-------
1.both active and passive mode 
2.inputs are speech
3.inputed speech ins converted with text using prelearned language kit
4.language kit contais dictionary,language model,hidden markov model, vocabulary
5.dictionary contain all the words and matched result will be returned
6.this is for both aactive and passive mthods
7.in passive mode only checks for hotword jarvis once find mode will be changed into active mode
8.and try to accept the word for module finding
10.above is the processing algorithm

how we find a person is talking or not?
---------------------------------------
1.initially we sample the audio input
2.calculate the threshold
3.set the threshold as backgroud threshold
4.listen to the mic
5.read the inputs simultaniously
6.once threshold rise which means some noise is produced 
7.save it into wav file and pass to speech operation
8.continue this process in passive listen for hotword detection
9.noise detection algorithm

module selection-detection
--------------------------
1.each module contain two functions
2.handle() and isValid()
3.once keyword from active mode obtained it will cheks with all the modules
4.if isValid() of a prticular module returns true
5.then use that module
6.handle() function do the operation for that specif module
7.else checks other modules isValid until return true or through all modules
9.above is the algorithm for module selection

Networking
-----------
1.here we are using the concept of distributed computing
2.server-client relation
3.rasspberry pi act as the central server
4.pi needs static ip
5.databses are also stored in the pi

website & database
-------------------
1.for website we use python
2.which will act as a rest api
3.when the users request for particular operatioon 
4.it will perform the operation
5.if any database operation thn it will do it
6.like switch on, reading temprature and humidity
7.motion detection in room

switch/sensor working
----------------------
1.their is a table for switch control
2.once their is change occur in table then it will be returned
3.their is lister 
4.listen whole time in table and returned the value to arduino through serial communication
5.the same listner read the inputs from the arduino temprature/hummidity
6.once their is change of temprature is occured compared to previous 
7.temprature / humidity values will be updated in sensor table along with time
8.these values are returned if necessary

android-app
------------
1.open the app n press button to speak
2.once switch is pressed it starts to record 
3.until a silence is occured
4.convert the speech into text using google speech library
5.the library is perfect one 
6.the library is perfect because of its result of more than 6-10 yrs and still trying to make more precise
7.once speech is converted text
8.it will send to our flask rest api as a http request
9.once rest api get the txt process changes to normal flow
10.txt is handover to module selector then do the operations

txt to speech process
---------------------
1.input is processed text
2.once the text is obtained it further send to kernal with the support of festival framework
3.it further transform into a wav  file
4.once the text is converted to a wav file
5.its played throgh a sound player to produce sound

motion detection
----------------
1.initially capture a video frame using camera
2.set it as background image
3.dynamically capture images
4.compare these dynamic images with background images
5.pixel to pixel comparison
6.once change in pixel occured it will assume as a motion occured
7.its the motion detection algorithm
8.out put can be viewed in a website as motion jpeg
9.for printing the jpeg in website it is coverted into bytes
10.its the motion detection

currently inputting hotwords
----------------------------
Time
Temprature
Humidity
light on
light off
